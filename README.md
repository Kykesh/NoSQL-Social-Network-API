# NoSQL Social Network API

## Overview
 A highly scalable Social Network API leveraging the power of NoSQL databases with MongoDB. This project utilizes Express.js for efficient routing and Mongoose for object data modeling (ODM), facilitating the creation, updating, and management of user profiles, thoughts, reactions, and friendships. Designed for social media startups, it offers a robust solution for handling large volumes of unstructured data, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions on the platform. This API supports functionalities like user management, thought sharing, reactions, and building friend lists, making it an ideal backbone for developing full-fledged social networking applications. This project is a backend application for a social network web platform where users can post thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. It utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, with Express.js for routing and the Mongoose ODM for data modeling.
